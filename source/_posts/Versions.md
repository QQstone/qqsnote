#### 关于版本号和构建编号
> The standard build numbering convention makes use of a fourth numerical indicator which is appended
to the release number, where the fourth indicator is the build number.

+ For verification builds, the build number starts with a “1”, and increments with each successive
build. For each successive release, the build indicator starts again with zero’s.
+ For development builds, the build number starts with “20001” and increments with each
successive build. For each successive release, the build indicator starts again with zero’s.

Examples:
4.3.0.20134 – The 134th development build of release 4.3.0
4.3.0.4 – The 4th verification build of release 4.3.0

Release image naming convention -> Example: GxPicture_3.4.3.7.ISO
